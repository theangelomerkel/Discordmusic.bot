# Discordmusic.bot
This bot uses the discord.py library to interact with the Discord API and the youtube_dl library to download and play audio from YouTube.

You can call the !play command followed by a YouTube video URL, and the bot will join the voice channel of the user who called the command and play the audio from the video. You can also call the !stop command to make the bot leave the voice channel.

You will need to replace 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN' with your bot token. You can create a bot and get its token by following the instructions in this link: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html

Please keep in mind that this is just a sample code and you might need to add more functionality to the bot to make it more versatile.
